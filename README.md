# Virtuable
**Objective**: 
We aim to assist visually impaired people to efficiently
interact and attend virtual meetings.

**The problem we are aiming to solve**: 
Problems related to accessibility and involvement of the visually impaired in online
meetings, such as inability in visually locating and pressing the
specific keys to access the desired features like mic button, etc. Our
project will enable them to quickly access all the desired features on an
online platform using hand gestures as a tool.

**Novelty of our project**: 
We have implemented new visual and audio features for enhancing accessibility on online platforms which previously
didn’t exist. Our features can drastically enhance the interaction of
visually impaired people in online meetings and allow effective
communication and interaction required for socializing and learning on an
online platform.


**Tech Stack**: 
Python – OpenCV, Django,
JavaScript - Speech Recognition,
 HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
 
 
**Implementation**: 
We will use our website to implement our novel
features. We will use OpenCV for image processing and will use Django as
the backend. We will use specific hand gestures and map them with buttons
like Mute/Unmute, Hand raise, etc recognised by a distinct sound cue. We
will also add an additional Speech recognition feature using JavaScript.
So on pressing a particular hotkey, user's speech gets converted to text
which be sent in the chats or can be used as commands.
**Future Scope**: As we are freshers, we are learning how to build our
project as a chrome extension. If not possible during the hack, we will
definitely try to build it after the hack. As a chrome extension, it can
be used over any video conferencing service to access our cool features.
> Business Model - We aim to license out the extension to the major
online video conferencing platforms.

**Future Scope:
We plan to develop and provide our services through a web browser extension in collaboration with any leading video conferencing platform.
