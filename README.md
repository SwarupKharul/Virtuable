solves problems related to accessibility and involvement of the visually impaired in online meetings, such as inability in visually locating and pressing the specific keys to access the desired features like mic button, etc. Our project will enable them to quickly access all the desired features on an online platform using hand gestures as a tool.

Our features can drastically enhance the interaction of visually impaired people in online meetings and allow effective communication and interaction required for socializing and learning on an online platform.
